  "narrative": "Activity Summary:\nCase CASE_2706 was reviewed under typology RANDOM. The case is currently assessed as high risk with score 100.\n\nKey Suspicious Indicators:\n- Case typology labeled as RANDOM based on pattern parser classification. (category: typology_classification, linked_tx: 10)\n- Aggregate transaction value exceeds high-value threshold. (category: high_value_activity, linked_tx: 10)\n- Net flow is near zero relative to total inflow, indicating potential pass-through. (category: rapid_pass_through, linked_tx: 10)\n- Funds traversed 10 hops across accounts. (category: multi_hop_layering, linked_tx: 10)\n- Majority of transfers are cross-bank. (category: cross_bank_movement, linked_tx: 10)\n- Multiple originators or beneficiaries are involved. (category: multi_party_network, linked_tx: 10)\n- Multiple currencies appear within the transaction set. (category: multi_currency_activity, linked_tx: 10)\n- Rapid pass-through activity observed. (category: rapid_pass_through, linked_tx: 10)\n\nEvidence and Rationale:\nThe risk assessment combines transactional signals with explicit reasoning steps. Each reason is linked to transaction identifiers and supporting knowledge chunks retrieved from SAR typology/regulatory reference material.\n\nRecommended Action:\nEscalate for SAR filing review, preserve an audit trail of supporting evidence, and request analyst sign-off for final narrative submission.",
