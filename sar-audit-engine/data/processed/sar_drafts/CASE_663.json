(category=typology_classification, tx_count=10)\n- R02: Aggregate transaction value exceeds high-value threshold. (category=high_value_activity, tx_count=10)\n- R03: Net flow is near zero relative to total inflow, indicating potential pass-through.

  "narrative": "Activity Summary:\nCase CASE_663 was reviewed under typology In. The case is currently assessed as medium risk with score 50.\n\nKey Suspicious Indicators:\n- Case typology labeled as In based on pattern parser classification. (category: typology_classification, linked_tx: 10)\n- Aggregate transaction value exceeds high-value threshold. (category: high_value_activity, linked_tx: 10)\n- Net flow is near zero relative to total inflow, indicating potential pass-through. (category: rapid_pass_through, linked_tx: 10)\n- Majority of transfers are cross-bank. (category: cross_bank_movement, linked_tx: 10)\n- Multiple originators or beneficiaries are involved. (category: multi_party_network, linked_tx: 10)\n\nEvidence and Rationale:\nThe risk assessment combines transactional signals with explicit reasoning steps. Each reason is linked to transaction identifiers and supporting knowledge chunks retrieved from SAR typology/regulatory reference material.\n\nRecommended Action:\nEscalate for SAR filing review, preserve an audit trail of supporting evidence, and request analyst sign-off for final narrative submission.",
