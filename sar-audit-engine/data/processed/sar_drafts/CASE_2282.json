(category=typology_classification, tx_count=2)\n- R02: Aggregate transaction value exceeds high-value threshold. (category=high_value_activity, tx_count=2)\n- R03: Net flow is near zero relative to total inflow, indicating potential pass-through.

(category=rapid_pass_through, tx_count=2)\n\nGenerate a SAR narrative with sections:\n1) Activity Summary\n2) Key Suspicious Indicators\n3) Evidence and Rationale\n4) Recommended Action"

  "narrative": "Activity Summary:\nCase CASE_2282 was reviewed under typology In. The case is currently assessed as medium risk with score 50.\n\nKey Suspicious Indicators:\n- Case typology labeled as In based on pattern parser classification. (category: typology_classification, linked_tx: 2)\n- Aggregate transaction value exceeds high-value threshold. (category: high_value_activity, linked_tx: 2)\n- Net flow is near zero relative to total inflow, indicating potential pass-through. (category: rapid_pass_through, linked_tx: 2)\n- Rapid pass-through activity observed. (category: rapid_pass_through, linked_tx: 2)\n\nEvidence and Rationale:\nThe risk assessment combines transactional signals with explicit reasoning steps. Each reason is linked to transaction identifiers and supporting knowledge chunks retrieved from SAR typology/regulatory reference material.\n\nRecommended Action:\nEscalate for SAR filing review, preserve an audit trail of supporting evidence, and request analyst sign-off for final narrative submission.",
