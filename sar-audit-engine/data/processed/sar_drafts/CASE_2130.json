(category=typology_classification, tx_count=5)\n- R02: Aggregate transaction value exceeds high-value threshold. (category=high_value_activity, tx_count=5)\n- R03: Net flow is near zero relative to total inflow, indicating potential pass-through. (category=rapid_pass_through, tx_count=5)\n- R04: Majority of transfers are cross-bank. (category=cross_bank_movement, tx_count=5)\n- R05: Multiple originators or beneficiaries are involved. (category=multi_party_network, tx_count=5)\n- R06: Multiple currencies appear within the transaction set.

  "narrative": "Activity Summary:\nCase CASE_2130 was reviewed under typology BIPARTITE. The case is currently assessed as medium risk with score 64.\n\nKey Suspicious Indicators:\n- Case typology labeled as BIPARTITE based on pattern parser classification. (category: typology_classification, linked_tx: 5)\n- Aggregate transaction value exceeds high-value threshold. (category: high_value_activity, linked_tx: 5)\n- Net flow is near zero relative to total inflow, indicating potential pass-through. (category: rapid_pass_through, linked_tx: 5)\n- Majority of transfers are cross-bank. (category: cross_bank_movement, linked_tx: 5)\n- Multiple originators or beneficiaries are involved. (category: multi_party_network, linked_tx: 5)\n- Multiple currencies appear within the transaction set. (category: multi_currency_activity, linked_tx: 5)\n\nEvidence and Rationale:\nThe risk assessment combines transactional signals with explicit reasoning steps. Each reason is linked to transaction identifiers and supporting knowledge chunks retrieved from SAR typology/regulatory reference material.\n\nRecommended Action:\nEscalate for SAR filing review, preserve an audit trail of supporting evidence, and request analyst sign-off for final narrative submission.",
