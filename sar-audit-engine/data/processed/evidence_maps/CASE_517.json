Common structuring indicators: - Multiple transactions with deliberate fragmentation of a larger value. - Repeated activity around policy thresholds with similar counterparties. - Alternation between cash-like and electronic channels to obscure continuity. - Circular transfer behavior with limited economic purpose. Reasoning cues for SAR: - Include threshold context and explain why observed amounts are suspicious. - Tie repeated transaction cadence to potential evasion behavior. - Reference sender and beneficiary concentration where relevant."

Common layering indicators: - Sequential transfers across unrelated accounts and banks. - Rapid movement of funds after incoming credits. - Repeated near-offsetting in-flow and out-flow values. - Use of multiple payment corridors to break traceability. Reasoning cues for SAR: - Highlight hop depth and timeline compression between linked transactions. - Explain why account behavior is inconsistent with normal customer purpose. - Document cross-bank movement ratio and intermediate account concentration."
