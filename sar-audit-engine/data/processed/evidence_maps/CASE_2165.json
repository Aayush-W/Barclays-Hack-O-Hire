Common layering indicators: - Sequential transfers across unrelated accounts and banks. - Rapid movement of funds after incoming credits. - Repeated near-offsetting in-flow and out-flow values. - Use of multiple payment corridors to break traceability. Reasoning cues for SAR: - Highlight hop depth and timeline compression between linked transactions. - Explain why account behavior is inconsistent with normal customer purpose. - Document cross-bank movement ratio and intermediate account concentration."

Reasoning cues for SAR: - Show transaction velocity and clustering in short time windows. - Map repeated amount bands and sender diversity. - Explain how volume pattern indicates deliberate threshold avoidance."
