Common structuring indicators: - Multiple transactions with deliberate fragmentation of a larger value. - Repeated activity around policy thresholds with similar counterparties. - Alternation between cash-like and electronic channels to obscure continuity. - Circular transfer behavior with limited economic purpose. Reasoning cues for SAR: - Include threshold context and explain why observed amounts are suspicious. - Tie repeated transaction cadence to potential evasion behavior. - Reference sender and beneficiary concentration where relevant."

Common smurfing indicators: - Burst of low-to-mid value deposits from multiple senders. - Repeated transaction amounts that remain below expected escalation limits. - Consolidation of many small credits into one beneficiary account. - Frequent ACH or card-like channels with short intervals. Reasoning cues for SAR: - Show transaction velocity and clustering in short time windows. - Map repeated amount bands and sender diversity. - Explain how volume pattern indicates deliberate threshold avoidance."
