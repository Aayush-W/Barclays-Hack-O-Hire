Common funnel-account indicators: - One account receives funds from many origins and disburses to fewer exits. - Minimal retention of value (near-zero net flow over short periods). - Rapid pass-through with dwell time measured in hours. - Multi-bank routing to reduce direct source-to-destination linkage. Reasoning cues for SAR: - Quantify inbound-outbound imbalance and dwell-time metrics. - Trace linked transactions that form the funnel path. - Explain why account profile does not match expected customer behavior."
