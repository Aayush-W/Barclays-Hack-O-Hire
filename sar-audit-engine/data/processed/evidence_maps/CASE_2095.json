Common funnel-account indicators: - One account receives funds from many origins and disburses to fewer exits. - Minimal retention of value (near-zero net flow over short periods). - Rapid pass-through with dwell time measured in hours. - Multi-bank routing to reduce direct source-to-destination linkage. Reasoning cues for SAR: - Quantify inbound-outbound imbalance and dwell-time metrics. - Trace linked transactions that form the funnel path. - Explain why account profile does not match expected customer behavior."

          "excerpt": "Smurfing typology describes structuring funds into many smaller transfers to avoid control thresholds. Common smurfing indicators: - Burst of low-to-mid value deposits from multiple senders. - Repeated transaction amounts that remain below expected escalation limits. - Consolidation of many small credits into one beneficiary account. - Frequent ACH or card-like channels with short intervals. Reasoning cues for SAR: - Show transaction velocity and clustering in short time windows. - Map repeated amount bands and sender diversity. - Explain how volume pattern indicates deliberate threshold avoidance."
