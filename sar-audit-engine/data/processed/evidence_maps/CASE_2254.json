Common structuring indicators: - Multiple transactions with deliberate fragmentation of a larger value. - Repeated activity around policy thresholds with similar counterparties. - Alternation between cash-like and electronic channels to obscure continuity. - Circular transfer behavior with limited economic purpose. Reasoning cues for SAR: - Include threshold context and explain why observed amounts are suspicious. - Tie repeated transaction cadence to potential evasion behavior. - Reference sender and beneficiary concentration where relevant."
