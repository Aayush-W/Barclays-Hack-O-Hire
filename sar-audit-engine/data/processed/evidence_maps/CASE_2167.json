Common smurfing indicators: - Burst of low-to-mid value deposits from multiple senders. - Repeated transaction amounts that remain below expected escalation limits. - Consolidation of many small credits into one beneficiary account. - Frequent ACH or card-like channels with short intervals. Reasoning cues for SAR: - Show transaction velocity and clustering in short time windows. - Map repeated amount bands and sender diversity. - Explain how volume pattern indicates deliberate threshold avoidance."
