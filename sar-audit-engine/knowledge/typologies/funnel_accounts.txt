Funnel-account typology centers on accounts that receive many inbound transfers and rapidly forward funds onward.

Common funnel-account indicators:
- One account receives funds from many origins and disburses to fewer exits.
- Minimal retention of value (near-zero net flow over short periods).
- Rapid pass-through with dwell time measured in hours.
- Multi-bank routing to reduce direct source-to-destination linkage.

Reasoning cues for SAR:
- Quantify inbound-outbound imbalance and dwell-time metrics.
- Trace linked transactions that form the funnel path.
- Explain why account profile does not match expected customer behavior.
