Layering typology focuses on separating illicit proceeds from the original source through multiple account hops.

Common layering indicators:
- Sequential transfers across unrelated accounts and banks.
- Rapid movement of funds after incoming credits.
- Repeated near-offsetting in-flow and out-flow values.
- Use of multiple payment corridors to break traceability.

Reasoning cues for SAR:
- Highlight hop depth and timeline compression between linked transactions.
- Explain why account behavior is inconsistent with normal customer purpose.
- Document cross-bank movement ratio and intermediate account concentration.
