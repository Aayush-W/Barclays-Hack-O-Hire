Structuring involves splitting deposits or payments to reduce detectability against internal controls.

Common structuring indicators:
- Multiple transactions with deliberate fragmentation of a larger value.
- Repeated activity around policy thresholds with similar counterparties.
- Alternation between cash-like and electronic channels to obscure continuity.
- Circular transfer behavior with limited economic purpose.

Reasoning cues for SAR:
- Include threshold context and explain why observed amounts are suspicious.
- Tie repeated transaction cadence to potential evasion behavior.
- Reference sender and beneficiary concentration where relevant.
