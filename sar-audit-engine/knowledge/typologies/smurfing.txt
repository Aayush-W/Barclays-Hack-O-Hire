Smurfing typology describes structuring funds into many smaller transfers to avoid control thresholds.

Common smurfing indicators:
- Burst of low-to-mid value deposits from multiple senders.
- Repeated transaction amounts that remain below expected escalation limits.
- Consolidation of many small credits into one beneficiary account.
- Frequent ACH or card-like channels with short intervals.

Reasoning cues for SAR:
- Show transaction velocity and clustering in short time windows.
- Map repeated amount bands and sender diversity.
- Explain how volume pattern indicates deliberate threshold avoidance.
