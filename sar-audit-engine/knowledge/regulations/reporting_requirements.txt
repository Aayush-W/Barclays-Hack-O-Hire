SAR reporting requirements (generic operational guidance):

- A SAR should be prepared when there is reasonable suspicion that funds involve illicit activity,
  are intended to hide source of funds, or lack clear lawful purpose.
- Narratives should include the who, what, when, where, and how of suspicious behavior.
- Analysts should document linked accounts, transaction paths, and quantitative indicators.
- Evidence used in the narrative should be traceable to source transactions and system outputs.
- Escalation decisions should be logged with timestamp, analyst identity, and review outcome.
