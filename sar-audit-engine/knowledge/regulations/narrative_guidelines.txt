SAR narrative drafting guidelines:

- Use objective, factual language and avoid speculative statements.
- Present a clear chronology of events and transaction behavior.
- Explain why activity is suspicious using measurable indicators.
- Reference typology alignment and controls-impact rationale.
- Include supporting evidence identifiers (transaction IDs, account links, and detection metrics).
- Conclude with recommended action and whether escalation for filing is advised.
